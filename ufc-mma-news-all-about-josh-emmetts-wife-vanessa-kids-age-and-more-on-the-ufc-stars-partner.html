But, he has a brilliant support system in his partner and family to keep him going. The fighter is married to his high school sweetheart and the pair is inseparable in their own right.</p><p>In 2018, after his fight against <strong>Jeremy Stephens</strong>, Emmett’s state was terrifying. And it only came to light when Vanessa’s instinct kicked in. Even though an unfazed Emmett kept walking around as if he was in no pain, his wife took him to the hospital to discover unspeakable damage. Such is their bond. So let’s find out more about this remarkable woman.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Who is Vanessa and how did they meet?</h2><p><strong>Josh Emmett and Vanessa</strong> first came across each other in high school. The two have been together since and have been married for about two decades now. A companionship as such is incredibly rare to come across today. But for Vanessa and Emmett, it’s all they’ve ever known.</p><p>Vanessa is a fitness enthusiast and trainer. The two got married back in 2012, and have two children as of now. Their bond has been on display and the love they have for one another is palpable from their social media posts. These two are also globe trotters and seem to have covered numerous places like Vietnam, Spain, France, the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom, Hawaii, and more.&nbsp;Another instance of their love is of course when Vanessa Emmet saved her husband from potentially losing eyesight and much more.</p><p>Emmett lost to Stephens in their 2018 encounter inside the Octagon. He lost via a knockout that included a barrage of punches, an elbow, and an illegal knee. Days later, Emmett was back home behaving like nothing was wrong even though he had been severely injured during the fight.</p><img id=img-tag-node--img-loader-0 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Untitled-2023-12-05T152916.485.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Vanessa Emmett’s instinct kicked in and she took him to the hospital quickly where the doctors informed them that Emmett’s left eye socket floor had shattered. Orbital bone broken with a cheek that had caved in. He could have lost sight with ease. Thanks to Vanessa, his career is still ongoing and his sight is in good shape. A woman’s instinct as they say!</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>How did Vanessa discover the injuries of Josh Emmett?</h2><p>For his wife who had been with him for so long, it was only natural to see what others couldn’t. Vanessa felt like something was off with Emmett because she’d been with him through wins and losses in his MMA career, and yet this time was just a bit different.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-ufc-mma-news-didnt-think-it-was-possible-for-a-dagestani-to-cry-islam-makhachev-breaks-down-as-fans-witness-josh-emmett-hurting-before-ufc-284?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1180845666-473x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">“Didn’t Think It Was Possible for a Dagestani to Cry” – Islam Makhachev Breaks Down as Fans Witness Josh Emmett “Hurting” Before UFC 284</p></a><p>“In my gut, I just felt that something wasn’t right,” she had voiced at the time. “We’ve been through fights; he bounces back relatively quickly. I was just like, ‘I think we need to go to the hospital and get a second opinion.'”&nbsp;And sure enough, she was right on the money.</p><p>Now, as Emmett prepares for his next fight, his opponent <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Giga Chikadze has pulled out</a>. So the looming question of who will he fight instead remains!</p><p>Who do you think Emmett should face next?
