When she was just 13 years old, she defeated adolescents five years older than her to win the national Junior title. Kharlan received his education at Mykolaiv’s Admiral Makarov National University of Shipbuilding.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/30130014/000_1IY8RR-800x520-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Olha Kharlan career</h2><p>Kharlan has also won two team world sabre championships, six individual European titles, and two team titles.</p><p>She has competed in the Olympics four times total, winning the team gold in 2008, the team silver in 2016, and the individual bronze twice.</p><p>Kharlan took part in the Olympics in 2008 in Beijing, 2012 in London, 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, and 2020 in Tokyo.</p><p>Kharlan was admitted into the International Fencing Federation’s (Fédération Internationale d’Escrime; FIE) hall of fame and was voted athlete of the year at the 2009 Ukrainian Heroes of Sports Year awards.
