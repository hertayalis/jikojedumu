Bader's father, William, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2013, and he died three years later. Diedrich told "ALZ Magazine" in 2022, "It's a trap to look at the person [with Alzheimer's] and think, 'This is what he or she was at one time, and look at him or her now.' There's no point in it. It's extremely painful. I was much happier when I just dealt with the situation as it was in the exact moment â€” to be entirely present â€” and it's better for them as well." Bader is an Alzheimer's Association Celebrity Champion, and he encourages people to use the "Yes, and" principle of improv to connect with those who are living with Alzheimer's. Diedrich shared an experience he had with his father near the end of his life, stating, "He turned to me and goes, 'You need to shave.' I said, 'Yeah, I just haven't gotten around to it.' He said, 'I should probably teach you.' Both of our beards were gray, and he taught me how to shave again. He gave me a full instruction, he lathered up and we did the razors side by side in the mirror. It was really beautiful." Bader added, "If I hadn't had 'Yes, and' in my head, I would've said, 'You know, I'm 50, I know how to shave.' I was grateful for that. It was a lovely moment."</p><h2 id=awards-nominations><strong>Awards and Nominations</strong></h2><p>Bader has been nominated for five Behind the Voice Actors Awards, one as an individual and four as a member of an ensemble.
