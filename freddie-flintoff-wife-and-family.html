Rachael, 43, is a former model and ran her own successful events company Strawberry Promotions from the age of 19 up until 2006. The happy couple met in 2002 at a cricket ground in Birmingham while Rachael was promoting her business.

I couldn't do it any longer."</p><h2>Freddie Flintoff's children</h2><p id=eNvIevRKugxd data-wc=68><strong>Freddie and Rachael have four children together.</strong> Their first baby was a daughter, Holly, born in 2004. Shortly after they welcomed Corey, and then another son, Rocky, in 2008. In April 2020, the pair then announced that they had welcomed their fourth child, another boy, the previous Christmas.

"My career at the time, I started doing really well," he told the First Time Dads podcast. "Everyone said that couldn't happen, but it put everything into perspective.
