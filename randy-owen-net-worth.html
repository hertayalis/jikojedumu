Most people know him as a country music musician, and the lead singer in the successful country rock group Alabama. He has enjoyed a successful career as both a singer/performer in the United States as well as other regions of the world.</p><p>Are you wondering how wealthy Randy Owen is? His net worth is estimated to be an impressive $50 million, acquired mostly from his country music career, singing hit songs such as ‘Why Lady Why’ and ‘Tennessee River,’ among many others. He has also performed in many countries, showcasing his talent when it comes to singing and playing guitar.</p><h3>Randy Owen Net Worth $50 Million</h3><p>Randy Owen was born and raised on a farm in Fort Payne, Alabama USA. He dropped out of high school in ninth grade, before going back to Fort Payne High to graduate in 1969. During this time, Owen and Teddy Gentry, his cousin, started playing music together, before recruiting Jeff Cook, another cousin, and forming the band Wildcountry. They first performed during an annual high school talent show, and won. Owen subsequently continued with his studies, earning a degree from Jackson State University. The three cousins then re-formed, added drummer Bennet Vartanian, before Rick Scott took over in 1974. They changed the group name to Alabama in 1977, and signed a contract with GRT. Randy’s net worth began to rise.</p><p>In 1979, Rick Scott was replaced by Mark Herndon, a rock drummer, and following impressive independent singles and a self-released album, the group signed with RCA records, which helped them release their hit single ‘Tennessee River’ in 1980, which jump-started their career, and their net worth, eventually resulted in 21 multi-platinum,, platinum and gold albums; and 42 top singles. In total, the band has sold an amazing 73 million albums, besides ‘Tennessee River’ including ‘Old Fame,’ Love in the first Degree,’ ‘Lady Down on Love,’ ‘The Closer you Get,’ ‘Roll On,’ and ‘Fire in the Night’.</p><p>From 1982 through to 1997, the group organized Alabama June Jam, an annual event that raised money for school organizations and charities. In honor of this, the group received a Bob Hope Humanitarian Award, Minnie Pearl Humanitarian Award, and Humanitarian Award by Country Radio Broadcaster. On his own, Randy supports disadvantaged children, collecting over $1 million in total for that initiative. He also helped St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital by organizing an event that raised more than $345 million.</p><p>In 2002, Alabama announced its decision to retire, after a US farewell tour in 2002 and 2003.</p><p>Owen and his group members have received many awards, including the title of ‘Artist of the Decade, ‘an award given at the Academy of Country Music in 1989; two Grammy Awards; and two People’s Choice Awards. In 1999, Alabama was also given the award of ‘Country Group of the Century’ by the Recording Industry Association of America. The group also received ‘The Spirit of Alabama,’ an award given by Governor, Rob Riley.</p><p>In 2008 and 2011, Owen released two albums as a solo artist called ‘One on One’ and’ Friends’ respectively. Following Alabama’s disbandment, he moved to Country Gold, a classic country request show on Westwood One, in July 2012. On his arrival, the program was reformatted, switching from a live requests to a pre-recorded format. He was tasked to play classic country music songs, including those released in the 90s and 2000s.</p><p>Randy Owen still lives in Fort Payne, with his wife of 40 years Kelly, with whom he has three children. Owen rears cattle on his ranch, and is eager to increase his net worth by running a farm in northeast Alabama.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=18.36602357985><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Randy Owen</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$50 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>December 13, 1949</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Fort Payne, Alabama, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 11 in (1.82 m)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Profession</td><td>Singer, Songwriter, Composer, Music artist, Guitarist</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Jacksonville State University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Kelly Owen (m. 1975)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Children</td><td>Alison Sena Yeuell, Heath Yeuell, Randa Rosanne Yeuell</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Nicknames</td><td>Owen, Randy , Randy Yeuell Owen , Alabama , Tartop</td></tr><tr readability=0.39024390243902><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/randyowen</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.31818181818182><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/randyowenmusic</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35897435897436><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.myspace.com/randyowen</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1191989</a></td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>Alabama</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Nominations</td><td>Grammy Award for Best Country Song, Academy of Country Music Award for Song of the Year, Angels Among Us, Dixieland Delight, Mountain Music</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Movies</td><td>Alabama: For the Record: 41 Number One Hits, Alabama: Greatest Video Hits, Legends & Lyrics: Vol. 1: Kris Kristofferson, Patty Griffin and Randy Owen</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Nashville Star</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Soundtrack <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=soundtrack readability=7><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>Smoky Mountains Rise: A Benefit for the My People Fund</td><td>2016</td><td>TV Movie writer: "Lady Down On Love"</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Late Show with David Letterman</td><td>2011</td><td>TV Series writer - 1 episode</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Fire Down Below</td><td>1997</td><td>writer: "Pass It On Down"</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Diggstown</td><td>1992</td><td>writer: "Mountain Music"</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Dolly</td><td>1987</td><td>TV Series writer - 1 episode</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Six Pack</td><td>1982</td><td>writer: "Mountain Music" - uncredited</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=11><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Smoky Mountains Rise: A Benefit for the My People Fund</td><td>2016</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Himself (as Alabama)</td></tr><tr><td>CMT Insider</td><td>2008-2011</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Headline Country</td><td>2011</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Nashville at Nite</td><td>2008</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>43rd Annual Academy of Country Music Awards</td><td>2008</td><td>TV Special</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gone Country</td><td>2008</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>2007 CMT Music Awards</td><td>2007</td><td>TV Special</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Nashville Star</td><td>2007</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Judge</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Alabama: American Farewell Tour</td><td>2003</td><td>Video</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Our Country</td><td>2003</td><td>Documentary short</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Alabama: 41 Number One Hits Live</td><td>1998</td><td>Video documentary</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>American Bandstand's 40th Anniversary Special</td><td>1992</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Himself - Member of Alabama (uncredited)</td></tr><tr><td>The Full Moon Show</td><td>1991</td><td>TV Series documentary</td><td>Themselves</td></tr><tr><td>Hot Country Nights</td><td>1991</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>The 13th Annual People's Choice Awards</td><td>1987</td><td>TV Special</td><td>Himself - Accepting Award for Favourite Musical Group</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Alabama...
