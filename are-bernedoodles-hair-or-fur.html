Bernedoodles with a more curly coat are more like the poodle and will not shed. It is very rare to have a bernedoodle with straight hair.</span></span><h2>Does a Bernedoodle shed hair?</h2>Ultimate Guide to Best Non-Shedding Bernedoodles. Bernedoodles are the loveable Poodle mix cross between a Bernese Mountain Dog and a Poodle. Like most Poodle Mix Cross Breeds, Bernedoodles are known to be low to no shedders.<h2>What kind of hair do Bernedoodles have?</h2>Bernedoodles usually come in one of three coat types: straight, wavy and curly. What is this? Straight “hair coat” – The straight coats usually shed the most and are the least hypoallergenic of the three coat types. Even though this coat is called “straight” or flat, it may actually have a slight wave to it.<h2>Why is my Bernedoodle not curly?</h2>Why Does My Bernedoodle Have Straight Hair? Straight hair is one of the traits a Bernedoodle puppy can inherit from their Bernese Mountain Dog lineage. Bernedoodles with a flat coat lack the “Cu Locus” (KRT71) gene that can be passed on from the Poodle side of this mix.<h2>Should you shave a Bernedoodle?</h2>Their topcoat will no longer protect them from the elements, and their undercoat won't insulate properly. Usually, this means that double-coats can be trimmed, especially around the dog's ears and face. However, they cannot be shaved down any considerable amount.<h2>7 Reasons You SHOULD NOT Get a Bernedoodle</h2><p></p><h2>Are Bernedoodles high maintenance?</h2>Only consider getting a Bernedoodle if you have the time as well as resources necessary to properly take care of and groom a high maintenance dog such as the Bernedoodle. Bernese Mountain Dog and Poodle mix makes an excellent dog for an active family with older kids.<h2>How often should a Bernedoodle be bathed?</h2>The dog needs these natural oils to keep the skin moisturized and healthy. With that said, the Bernedoodle should only be bathed every three to four months. If your Bernedoodle spends a lot of time outdoors and has a love of water and mud puddles, you may find yourself bathing him more often.<h2>Should I get a male or female Bernedoodle?</h2>Differences between male and female Bernedoodles.<p>Males might tend to be more affectionate and goofy, but also a bit more stubborn while females can be more independent but easier to train and less stubborn. The differences are actually quite subtle, and both males and females make absolutely amazing pets.</p><h2>Should I get a Bernedoodle or goldendoodle?</h2>Bernedoodle vs Goldendoodle: Temperament<p>Bernedoodles are much calmer and more relaxed than Goldendoodles. Many Bernedoodles are happy just to sit and cuddle with their owners, but Goldendoodles have higher energy levels and will be looking to play more.</p><h2>Which Bernedoodle sheds least?</h2>Curly “wool” coat – The curly coat will shed the least and is the most hypoallergenic of the three types. The curls on this coat are usually tight with a soft texture much like what you would see on a Poodle. Curly coats may still shed, but they shed the hair upon themselves rather than on your floor.<h2>Is a Bernedoodle hypoallergenic?</h2>Bernedoodles are considered a hypoallergenic dog breed thanks to the influence of the genes that they may inherit from their Poodle parent. Poodles are recognised as a hypoallergenic dog breed by the AKC given their low shedding coat and their minimal amount of dander.<h2>Why does my Bernedoodle shed so much?</h2>Puppy Coat<p>Somewhere around 6 months of age, you might notice that your Bernedoodle sheds more than usual. This is due to the fact that they are transitioning their puppy coats into their adult coats.</p><h2>What is the average cost of a Bernedoodle?</h2>However, the average Bernedoodle cost is $2,000 to $5,000. But even then there is a big difference between what you get when you pay $2,000 vs $5,000. Much like other types of doodles, there is a wide range of factors that go into the price of a Bernese Mountain Dog Poodle Mix .<h2>Do Bernedoodles like to cuddle?</h2>Along with their friendliness, Bernedoodles are loyal, goofy, and affectionate. They love being around people so much, especially their human family. These pooches need both playtime and cuddle sessions with their favorite humans to be happy.<h2>Which is the calmest Doodle?</h2><p>The calmest Doodle mixes are those that were created by crossing Poodles with very laid-back breeds.<br>...<br>For example:</p><ul><li>The Maltipoo – a cross of Miniature or Toy Poodle and Maltese.</li><li>The Cavapoo: A mix of Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and Mini or Toy Poodle.</li><li>The Mini Bernedoodle – a cross of Bernese Mountain Dog and Mini Poodle.</li></ul><h2>What problems do Bernedoodles have?</h2>Health. There are, however, some conditions that Bernedoodles may be predisposed to, including hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, eye problems, and skin issues such as allergies and hot spots. All breeds may be affected by any number of health concerns, but the Bernedoodle is generally a healthy breed.<h2>What are the pros and cons of a Bernedoodle?</h2>Bernedoodle Cons. While Bernedoodles are usually low shedding dogs that often considered hypoallergenic, so you won't have to do lots of vacuuming. Like we mentioned above, they'll usually be low shedding dogs with hypoallergenic qualities. Bernedoodles are dogs that will require a lot of grooming.<h2>Why you should not get a Bernedoodle?</h2>Bernedoodles are prone to separation anxiety: Because they like to be around their pack, they can get anxious when left alone for too long. If you work long hours, this could be a challenge. You can combat this by signing your dog up for daily doggy daycare.<h2>Do Bernedoodles like to dig?</h2>If your Bernedoodle is not getting enough exercise, he may start to develop destructive tendencies such as digging or chewing.<h2>Do Bernedoodle puppies change color?</h2>Bernedoodles often carry the fading gene that's inherited from the Poodle's side of the lineage. For this reason, it's not uncommon for Bernedoodles to change color as they age. Black Bernedoodles can fade into gray or silver tones, and chocolate Bernedoodles might fade into silver, silver beige, and beige tones.<h2>Do Bernedoodles like swimming?</h2>Whether it is genetics or their innate personality, some dogs will never take well to the water. Most Bernedoodles will like swimming and playing in the water.<h2>Does Bernedoodle bark?</h2>They're truly loveable fur babies. Bernedoodles bark, but not ad nauseum. What Bernedoodles lack in bark they certainly make up for with cuddles. Possibly due to their poodle ancestry, they require a lot of attention which could manifest as jumping up on you or the couch to get just what they want.<h2>What is a Phantom Bernedoodle?</h2>Phantom Bernedoodle puppies are usually born with their rust markings. Some Phantom Bernedoodles are born looking pure black. If you look under the tail and they have brown markings that is a good indicator that the puppy will eventually have phantom markings.<h2>Are Bernedoodles hard to potty train?</h2>In general the Bernedoodle is an easy to train dog. Bernedoodles are an incredibly clever breed. They can be potty trained effectively. They are however notoriously stubborn and can provide resistance to puppy training.<h2>Are Bernedoodles fussy eaters?</h2>Bernedoodles are generally not picky eaters; in fact, quite the reverse. While this may seem like a good thing (you won't have to worry too much about your pup not liking their new food), you do have to be careful that your dog is not eating the wrong thing or even too much of the right thing.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8CrnGaalae7prDOqJulnaNitaK10Wamq2WWqr8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./christa-toro-net-worth-262132.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Christa Toro Net Worth">&larr;
