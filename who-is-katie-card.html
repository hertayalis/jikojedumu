She expressed hope that Robert would reflect on his actions and reach out to do the right thing.

According to his family, Card recently began wearing powerful hearing aids to address his hearing impairment. However, instead of providing relief, these aids seemed to exacerbate his condition. Card started claiming that he could hear people abusing him, even at the locations where the shootings occurred. These delusions may have played a significant role in his actions, as he believed he was responding to real threats.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Previous_Mental_Health_Treatment></span>Previous Mental Health Treatment<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Card’s family has revealed that he had been grappling with mental health issues for some time.
