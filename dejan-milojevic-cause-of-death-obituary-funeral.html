He was also the assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Before achieving that feat, Dejan played professionally as a power forward from 1994 until 2009, appearing for the FR Yugoslavia / Serbia and Montenegro league teams Beovuk, FMP, Budućnost, and Partizan, as well as for Pamesa Valencia in Spain, and Galatasaray in Turkey. Dejan Milojevic passed on at the age of 46 on 17 January 2024. In this post, we will take a look at Dejan Milojevic’s Cause Of Death, Obituary, Funeral and other details about his career.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Dejan Milojevic Early Life</strong></h3><p>Milojevic was born on 15 April 1977 in Belgrade. He was raised in the&nbsp;suburb&nbsp;of&nbsp;Padinska Skela. From an early age, he had a great passion for sports, so at 13, he started playing basketball. So, he signed up for the&nbsp;KK Tašmajdan youth categories in 1990 through a friend already playing there. Starting in KK Tašmajdan’s youth system, teenage Milojević quickly began dominating over his age group, scoring 141 points in a 202–52 cadet (under-16) win versus OKK Beograd under-16 team in 1991, a still-standing record.</p><h3><strong>Dejan Milojevic Professional Career</strong></h3><p>Milojevic’s professional career began with Beovukin in 1994. He played there until 1998. From there, he joined ed the&nbsp;YUBA League&nbsp;club&nbsp;FMP&nbsp;from the Belgrade suburb of&nbsp;Železnik. He was with the club till 2000.</p><p>Dejan Milojević joined the FR Yugoslav champions Budućnost during the summer of 2000 in a big-money acquisition that saw the Podgorica club reportedly pay FMP a transfer fee of over DM1 million (~€600,000). After 4 years with the club, Dejan signed with the three-time defending champion Partizan. Despite having significantly better financial offers from&nbsp;Dynamo Moscow and Crvena Zvezda, the sought-after power forward ended up signing for Partizan out of the desire to play for coach Duško Vujošević. Although Partizan underachieved in the competition, Milojević was his usual dominant self, averaging 20.8 points, 11.5 rebounds, and just over 3 steals and assists per game. He was also the key player for Partizan’s other title rout in the domestic league, as they lost only one game during the playoffs. In the&nbsp;2005–06 season, Milojević had another double-double EuroLeague season, scoring 16.4 points and grabbing 10 rebounds per game, also winning a couple of Player of the Week honours.</p><p>At the end of his coaching career, Dejan became the head coach of the Serbian team Mega Vizura. In his first season with the team, he had great success, leading his team to the Basketball League of Serbia&nbsp;playoff semifinals, thus clinching a spot in the regional&nbsp;Adriatic League&nbsp;for the&nbsp;next season. On 1 June 2020, he ended his tenure with Mega Basket.&nbsp;Over 345 games during eight seasons, he had a 173–172 record.</p><p>On 28 January 2021, Montenegrin club&nbsp;Budućnost hired Milojević as their new head coach, signing him to a two-and-a-half-year contract.&nbsp;The appointment came one day after the previous head coach&nbsp;Petar Mijović resigned midway through the 2020–21 season.</p><p>On 3 June 2021, Milojević won the&nbsp;Montenegrin Cup&nbsp;tournament following a 102–93 win over&nbsp;Mornar. Later that month, he won the&nbsp;Montenegrin League Championship after his team had a 3–0 win over Mornar in the 2021 Finals.&nbsp;He left Budućnost in June 2021 to join the&nbsp;Golden State Warriors,&nbsp;thus exercising the NBA opt-out clause in his contract with the Montenegrin club.</p><h3><strong>Dejan Milosevic Cause of Death</strong></h3><p>On 16 January 2024, Milojević was hospitalised after suffering a heart attack at a&nbsp;Salt Lake City&nbsp;restaurant while dining with fellow Warriors coaches and players. The hospitalisation resulted in the postponement of the Warriors game against the&nbsp;Utah Jazz, which had been scheduled for the following day.&nbsp;He died the following day, on 17 January, at the age of 46.</p><h3><strong>Dejan Milojevic Obituary</strong></h3><p>Milojević, an assistant coach with the Golden State Warriors and a respected figure in Serbian basketball, tragically passed unexpectedly in Utah on Wednesday after a heart attack. Milojević was known for his mentorship of Nikola Jokic, a two-time NBA Most Valuable Player. The organisation published an official notice regarding his untimely death.
