Over his eight-season career, Yao’s salary from the NBA formed the foundation of his earnings. Despite his career being cut short by injuries, Yao’s NBA contracts, including his five-year, $75 million contract extension signed in 2005, significantly boosted his net worth.</p><h2 id=endorsement-deals-and-sponsorships-KgaBZTGbJu>Endorsement Deals and Sponsorships</h2><p>Yao’s towering presence on the court and his affable personality off it made him an attractive figure for endorsements.
