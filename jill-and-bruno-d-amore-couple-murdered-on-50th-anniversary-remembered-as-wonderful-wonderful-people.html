The septuagenarian couple and Jill's 97-year-old mother, Lucia Arpino, were reportedly found dead on Sunday, June 25, at their residence in Massachusetts.</p><p>Described as "fantastic Italian people”, D'Amore and Jill were going to renew their wedding vows at Our Lady Help of Christians Church on their 50th wedding anniversary on Sunday. However, when they failed to show up, a worried friend went to check on them and discovered the gruesome crime. Authorities, who described the crime scene as bloody, have arrested their neighbor, Christopher Ferguson, in connection with the triple homicide. At the scene, officials discovered a bloody footprint and fingerprints that they matched to Ferguson, who had been spotted on surveillance footage in the area on Saturday night, June 24. The 41-year-old is currently facing one count of murder, as well as assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and burglary.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><h2 class=split>'The greatest people you'd ever meet'</h2><p>The shocking deaths of the couple and Arpino sent shockwaves through the close-knit neighborhood. Rev Dan Riley, pastor of Sacred Heart and Our Lady's Collaborative, remembered the three victims as the "salt of the Earth, the greatest people you'd ever meet." "They're going to be horribly missed," he told .</p><p>In a letter to their church community, the couple’s family members said that they “lost their lives in a senseless act of violence." "It is with a heavy heart that we share that the terrible tragedy that happened yesterday in Newton hit very close to home, impacting our faith community and our own family," the letter read</p><p>The letter stated that 73-year-old Jill "had taken on the ministry of beautifying our church's environment and spent endless hours in the care of our church.” D'Amore, 74, was affectionately called the "head chef" because of his knack for flipping burgers at the parish picnics. He was also known for "his big voice and his exuberant personality." The letter further noted that Arpino never missed a 10 am mass and “for over 60 years she and her husband Alberto sat in the “North End” section of our church.”</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><h2 class=split>'His wife was a delightful, shy person'</h2><p>Riley further noted that D'Amore “was really excited about planning” the renewal of their vows. “His wife was a delightful, shy person. She would’ve loved it. So, it was a shock to find out after Mass,” he said.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><p>The pastor said that the family regularly attended mass and was highly active in the church. “Wonderful, wonderful people, beloved in the best sense, just wonderful Italian-Americans,” Riley told Boston 25 News, adding, “Just great people. From the family values to the tomato garden, to the house always being opened to everyone, just very friendly and very welcoming." A special Mass of Peace will be held at 6.30 pm on Tuesday, June 27, at Our Lady Help of Christians Church, 573 Washington St, Newton.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoopmhuW6tzZ1km6qlo7xusIyapKiqlWKwsMHPpZxmpaWnsaa%2BxJ1kqKZdan21tIyapaehppq%2FtK3RsmSrnZ2auqOx0Z6bZpmjYsSwusOeqZ%2BtnGLEsLrDnqmfrZxivaa7z6Wc</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./2023-interposers-tsmc-hints-at-2000mm2-12x-hbm-in-one-package.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="TSMC Hints at 3400mm2 + 12x HBM in one Package">&larr;
