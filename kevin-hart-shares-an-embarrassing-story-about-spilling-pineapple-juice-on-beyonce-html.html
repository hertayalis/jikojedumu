We’ve heard him talk about <a href=#>all kinds of wild things</a> — from his dating experiences and lying habits to his son’s anger tactics. But on March 31, he shared one of his most embarrassing stories yet, which involves the one and only Beyoncé Knowles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kevin-Hart-and-Beyonce.jpg><h2>Kevin Hart says he once spilled juice on Beyoncé</h2><p id=par-2_64>Hart said he had been at a club years ago when he ran into Jay-Z. After a “great conversation,” Jay-Z apparently offered Hart a drink, but because the club was so crowded, Hart knocked over a container of pineapple juice when he went to reach for it. Unbeknownst to him, Beyoncé had been standing nearby and had just gotten soaked with the juice.</p><p id=par-3_68>“He comes back up to me and goes, ‘Kev, you just spilled pineapple juice all over my wife’s legs and shoes,’” Hart recalled. “I say, ‘Get out of here.’ I look behind him, I see Bey sitting down … She got like a f*cking pound of napkins wiping everything … So I just look at Hov and say, ‘I need to make this right because I feel bad.’”</p><p id=par-4_50>He said he gave Jay-Z a rolled up $20 bill since that’s all he had at the time and quickly moved to another side of the club. Looking back at the rapper, Hart said he noticed Jay-Z had unrolled the bill and had a look of disgust on his face.</p><p id=par-5_23>“I couldn’t afford to cover that cost. I just paid for the pineapple juice and got the f*ck out of there,” Hart concluded.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2>Please be advised that this clip contains strong language</figure><h2>One of his good friends has also had an awkward run-in with Beyoncé</h2><p id=par-6_36>Hart’s pal Tiffany Haddish revealed to <a href=#>GQ</a> in March 2018 that she once witnessed an actress bite Beyoncé in the face at a party. She refused to say names but otherwise spoke candidly about the moment.</p><p id=par-7_48>“Beyoncé stormed away,” Haddish recalled, “went up to Jay-Z, and was like, ‘Jay! Come here!&nbsp;This&nbsp;b*tch—’ and snatched him. They went to the back of the room. I was like, ‘What just happened?’ And Beyoncé’s friend walked up and was like, ‘Can you believe this b*tch just bit Beyoncé?’&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_23>Haddish claimed that she was going to fight the actress but had been urged by Beyoncé to let it go and “have fun.”</p><p id=par-9_33>“She was like, ‘Tiffany, no. Don’t do that. That b*tch is on drugs. She not even drunk. The b*tch is on drugs. She not like that all the time. Just chill,'” Haddish continued.</p><p id=par-10_55>Even though she didn’t share the person’s identity, it wasn’t long after the interview that the Internet named Sanaa Lathan as the culprit. Lathan <a href=#>denied the claims</a> on Twitter. However, Haddish confirmed to <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> that she was indeed referring to the Love & Basketball star. Beyoncé herself has never commented on the matter.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS4psLIp2ShmaKperS0wKucrGWRo3qmucGaqauZo6i2r7OMrKuoqqlirqO71K1krKiZobmqusZmp6KmlZa9sbjEZqGuoZOaerC6jJucsqeemLJvtNOmo2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./payton-delu-wiki-height-ethnicity-boyfriend-net-worth-and-career.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Payton Delu : Wiki, Height, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Net Worth And Career">&larr;
