As a concept, the design of an upgradable and modifiable case existed for many years now but there were very few attempts on actually designing and retailing one. Cooler Master made many of these attempts, with their first notable attempt probably being the first generation Stacker ten years ago, a case with a rotatable motherboard tray that was both ATX and BTX compatible. However, the company is making very bold claims with the MasterCase 5, stating that it "offers absolute control over how your case looks and functions".</p><p>Unfortunately, that was not our experience. The MasterCase 5 is not much more than a typical Midi-ATX tower case, at least not with the number of extras available today. Absolute control over a case's appearance definitely implies much more than just a windowed side panel and a top cover, both of which items are factory options of the MasterCase Pro 5 anyway. Besides, the MasterCase Pro 5 retails for <a href=#>$140 incl. shipping</a>. The windowed side panel costs $25 and the top cover $17, while the MasterCase Pro 5 also has an extra 140 mm intake fan and a second HDD cage installed as well. Even if you just need to install more than two 3.5" drives, purchasing the MasterCase Pro 5 instead is a better option than getting the MasterCase 5 and an extra HDD cage. Technically, the modularity of the stock MasterCase 5 is limited to the movement of the single HDD cage up and down across the faceplate, assuming that there is no long graphics card or liquid cooling radiator to block it.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/9560/CMMS5_09_575px.JPG style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>On the contrary, the average size and the chassis design of the MasterCase 5 seem to impede modularity, not help it. The case is not large enough to house large components without interfering with something else. For example, a liquid cooling radiator at the front will block the installation of HDD cages and it is not possible to install it at the top without the extra top cover. Even though all of the drive cages are removable, the motherboard's tray or the floor separating the system area from the PSU compartment cannot be removed. These are more than just minor limitations of the design. Unless the trend picks up, with more products and accessories supporting Cooler Master's "Freeform" design, those who hoped for a truly modular case will soon be greatly disappointed. However, this could drastically change if Cooler Master introduces more cases based on the "Freeform" modular design, especially if the accessories and certain parts are interchangeable between them.</p><p>Still, not everything revolves around the "Freeform" design. As far as functionality and quality go, MasterCase 5 can still hold its own as a good Midi-ATX tower case. Aesthetics are a subjective factor but we believe that Cooler Master did a fine job addressing the MasterCase 5's intended target group. The elegant design and all-black color create an attractive but not extravagant appearance for today's modern environments. It is not complex enough to stand out too much in minimalistic office/work environments either. Some people will definitely find it too much for use in a living room though. &nbsp;As far as quality goes, the MasterCase 5 is well made. We found no significant structural issues or flaws. Cooler Master designed a strong chassis that will not easily bend or twist and used high quality plastic for the top and front covers. Despite the great number of holes and openings, there are no sharp edges or corners throughout the case. The simplicity of the nylon dust filters may be troubling in terms of effectiveness but that type of filter also tends to last for a lifetime without issues. Cooler Master definitely designed the MasterCase 5 with longevity in mind.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/9560/CMMS5_36_575px.JPG style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Financially, the existence of the standard MasterCase 5 version is not very reasonable. Even if the side panel is unnecessary, the top cover should be a stock option for cases of this range. Without it, the installation of a liquid cooling radiator is limited to the front of the case, reducing the clearance for graphics cards and blocking the installation of HDD cages. Cooler Master is also offering the MasterCase Pro 5, which is essentially the same cage with the side and top panels, an extra three drive cage and one more 140 mm cooling fan preinstalled. With the MasterCase Pro 5 retailing for <a href=#>$140 incl. shipping</a>, the <a href=#>$110 incl. shipping</a> retail price of the MasterCase 5 does not seem like much of a deal. If we suppose that the user would be happy with the stock options of the MasterCase 5, it does not really offer more than just another Midi-ATX tower case. There are literally dozens of other very good Midi-ATX cases around its price tag, placing very strong competition on Cooler Master's newest design.</p><p>In our humble opinion, Cooler Master should begin by applying the "Freeform" modular design to a larger, stronger case. Where virtually the only practical option of the MasterCase 5 is the choice between extra HDDs and long cards or a liquid cooling radiator, a larger case would provide room for more options and reduce overlap between them. It is very likely that the designers would end up with a rather expensive product, yet it would be targeting advanced enthusiasts, a market group that is frequently eager to pay the premium price for high performance equipment. The MasterCase 5 is well made and functional but not as versatile as the company suggests it is, and it is targeted at users who strongly consider the best value they can get for their money. With such a hefty price tag, it will be difficult for Cooler Master to convince the mainstream user that the MasterCase 5 is really worth it, unless they are prepared to empower Cooler Master's slogan and truly customize the design with a dremel and a unique color scheme.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/9560/CMMS5_27_575px.JPG style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>In summary, the MasterCase 5 is a mechanically good case but it is rather overpriced for what it can actually do. We have no reason not to recommend it for its quality or performance, but it is an expensive design and competition will be more than fierce. When the trend picks up, with more cases and accessories released, perhaps that will change. However, for the time being, the MasterCase 5 is not much more than just a good Midi-ATX tower amongst the dozens of other products available, but implements a step forward in the concept nonetheless. From the customization perspective, a 'MasterCase 7' or 'MasterCase 9' might offer a larger opportunity if Cooler Master has those on the cards for the future.&nbsp;Still, if you are excited about the (partial) modularity of the MasterCase 5 or you simply like its design a lot, we strongly suggest that you should go straight for the Pro version.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIZ2go9oq6GdXZi8sLjEq2SmmaOpsrN5zJqqrZ2imK60sYxuZKudpp6yuHuU</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./i-am-honestly-very-divided-content-creator-with-dwarfism-explains-the-pros-and-cons-of-wonka-casting-hugh-grant-as-an-oompa-loompa.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="I am honestly very divided: Content creator with dwarfism explains the pros and cons of Won">&larr;
