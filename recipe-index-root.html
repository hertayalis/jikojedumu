Itâ€™s an easy way to use up a surplus of too-soft or overripe apples, and as it cooks, it fills your house with the aroma of fresh apples and cinnamon. That smell is SO cozy on a crisp fall day. On its own, itâ€™d be enough to make anyone a homemade applesauce convert. But this homemade applesauce recipe gets better. It doesnâ€™t just smell goodâ€”it tastes good too! Itâ€™s tangy, lightly sweet, and full of spiced apple flavor. You can make it chunky ifâ€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If youâ€™re looking to refresh your repertoire of game day snacks this fall, look no further: these air fryer onion rings are exactly what you need! Theyâ€™re crispy on the outside, melty in the middle, and filled with sweet and savory onion flavor that will keep you coming back for more. In my opinion, theyâ€™re just as good, no, better, than regular onion rings, and theyâ€™re way less of a hassle to make at home. Fun, tasty, and fairly healthy, too, these air fryer onion rings are one of our new favorites.

Itâ€™s a colorful combination of fruits, cheeses, spreads, and snacks that Iâ€™ve been absolutely loving lately. Iâ€™m sharing it today because it would be a fantastic last-minute appetizer for a Labor Day party or cookout, but honestly, itâ€™s a great easy dinner idea, too. On warm nights when Iâ€™m not in the mood to cook, I slice up some fresh fruit, grab a handful of herbs from the porch, and pile them onto a fruit and cheese platter like this one. Jack and I savor the sweet, juicy fruit with the rich, saltyâ€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>When I sat down to write this summer appetizers post, I glanced over at the calendar I have hanging on my wall. September already? How did that happen?! We might be nearing the end of the season, but I hope you still have a BBQ, cookout, or casual get-together left in store. In my book, at least, thereâ€™s not much that beats catching up with family or friends on a warm afternoon or evening. And if it just so happens that thereâ€™s a plate of summer appetizers nearby, well, thatâ€™s even better. These easy summer appetizers include cruditÃ© platters, dips,â€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I love the simplicity of this blistered shishito peppers recipe. It relies on just 3 main ingredients â€“ shishito peppers, salt, and sesame oil â€“ but itâ€™s still flavorful, satisfying, and totally addictive. You might think youâ€™re going to eat one pepper, maybe&nbsp;two, but before you know it, youâ€™ll have devoured half the pan! Umâ€¦yes, Iâ€™m speaking from experience. If youâ€™re not familiar with shishito peppers, theyâ€™re small, thin-walled peppers that are traditionally used in Japanese and Korean cooking. These days, you can often find them at farmers markets in the US and at major grocery stores like Whole Foodsâ€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>These zucchini muffins are the perfect way to use up (or at least make a dent in) a summer surplus of zucchini. A single batch uses 2 full cups of shredded squashâ€¦and if youâ€™re anything like me, youâ€™re going to make WAY MORE than a single batch. Iâ€™m on my third already this summer! These zucchini muffins are moist, puffy, and warmly spiced with nutmeg and cinnamon. Theyâ€™re also fairly healthy. I make them with whole wheat flour, olive oil instead of melted butter, and, of course, lots of zucchini. Right now, my favorite breakfast is one of these zucchiniâ€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Last week I shared this cherry tomato pasta recipe, and now Iâ€™m onto these Caprese skewersâ€¦ If you couldnâ€™t tell, Iâ€™m having a moment with cherry tomatoes. I love how many different varieties are available at this time of year â€“ some are round and yellow, others are oblong and speckled with red. Still others are purple, orange, and green. When I see all these shapes and colors at the farmers market or grocery store, I can never resist bringing home some of each. Theyâ€™re just so darn pretty (and delicious, too!). You can toss them into a salad, topâ€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This healthy zucchini bread is a delicious breakfast or summer snack. I should know, because Iâ€™ve just finished my [redacted] slice of the season, and I donâ€™t see my healthy zucchini bread consumption slowing down anytime soon. ðŸ™‚ Like a traditional recipe, this healthy zucchini bread is moist, tender, and warmly spiced. Itâ€™s PACKED with zucchini, of course, but it also features a few other good-for-you ingredients that you wouldnâ€™t find in a regular loaf. Almond flour adds protein and healthy fats, and it gives this loaf an especially moist texture. And instead of melted butter, olive oil brings richness.â€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Over the last few weeks, Jack and I have eaten more of these peanut butter no-bake cookies than weâ€™d like to admit. Theyâ€™re sweet and nutty, with an addictive chewy texture that comes from lots of peanut butter and whole rolled oats. Weâ€™ve pretty much had a constant supply of them on hand, because as soon as you finish one batch, it only takes a few minutes to whip up another and pop it in the fridge to chill. I recommend you enjoy these peanut butter no-bake cookies for dessert or an afternoon treat, but if Iâ€™m being totally honest,â€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>It seems like everywhere is having a heat wave this week, so I thought Iâ€™d share a simple guide to how to cut a watermelonâ€¦aka summerâ€™s most refreshing fruit. Pre-cut watermelon is readily available in many grocery stores these days, but whenever you can, buy one whole, and chop it up yourself. For starters, itâ€™ll be fresher, and itâ€™ll have a better texture, as watermelon starts to soften and release juice once itâ€™s chopped. Plus, you can cut it to whatever size and shape you like. Wedges? Cubes? Balls? You got it. Youâ€™ll find my method for how to cutâ€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Heads up: these air fryer zucchini chips are one delicious snack. Theyâ€™re crispy on the outside, juicy in the middle, and filled with nutty Parmesan flavor. You might think youâ€™re going to try just one, or maybe two, but if youâ€™re anything like me, youâ€™re not. Youâ€™re going to munch on these air fryer zucchini chips until every last one is gone! I based this recipe on the baked zucchini chips I shared last summer. Both versions are super yummy, but at this time of year, I like how I can make the air fryer recipe without turning on theâ€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvVnpinnJyaurC60meaqKVfmK61scaoqbJnopqwqrzEZqCnnJWterO7zq1mpqeimnqzscKip56rX6i7oq%2FKaKean5VkhnA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./illioins-family-missing-father-clown-mask.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Illinois family missing since February after the &amp;quot;dr*g user&amp;quot; father was ordered to stay away from th">&larr;
