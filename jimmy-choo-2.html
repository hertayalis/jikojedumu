The company specializes in shoes, handbags, accessories, and fragrances, and it operates stores all over the world. Choo’s brand is also well-known among celebrities, notably Diana, Princess of Wales.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Jimmy Choo?</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Jimmy Choo </a>was born on November 15, 1948, as Jimmy Choo Yeang Keat in George Town, British Malaysia, into a Chinese family of shoemakers. His surname is Chow, however, it was misspelled “Choo” on his birth certificate. He acquired the craft of shoemaking from his father as a child, and at the age of 11, he constructed his first pair of slippers. Choo attended Cordwainers Technical College in Hackney, London, as a young adult from 1982 to 1984.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Jimmy Choo married to?</h2><p>Choo has two children, Emily and Danny, with his wife Rebecca Choi, who is from Hong Kong. The latter is a pop culture blogger and television personality who created the Smart Doll, a range of interchangeable vinyl fashion dolls. Mirai Suenaga, Danny’s first doll, became his virtual mascot. Choi and Choo both live in London.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are some of the awards gained by Jimmy Choo?</h2><p>Choo has received numerous awards for his contributions to fashion. In appreciation of his contributions to the United Kingdom, he was named an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 2002. Choo was awarded an honorary fellowship by the University of the Arts London to round out the decade. He was also named a Commander of the Order of the Meritorious Service in his own country of Malaysia in 2013.</p><p>Meanwhile, Choo decided to stay in London after college. He eventually ended up working for two different design firms for a total of nine years. Choo extended his business by creating his own shop in a rented old hospital building in 1986. He was quickly discovered by prominent events and organizations such as London Fashion Week and Vogue magazine. His shoes were featured in an eight-page spread in the latter, significantly raising his profile. Choo’s image was further enhanced by Diana, Princess of Wales’ support in the early 1990s.</p><p>In the early 1990s, Choo collaborated with fashion assistant Tamara Mellon through Vogue magazine. Mellon soon left the magazine, and she pitched Choo the concept of creating a luxury, ready-to-wear shoe line. Choo achieved precisely that in 1996, co-founding J. Choo Limited with Mellon, whose parents contributed cash for a 50% ownership in the company. The first Jimmy Choo store debuted in London on Motcomb Street.</p><p>Choo rose to prominence a few years later when he was mentioned in the fifth episode of the HBO television series “Sex and the City.” This marked the beginning of a new celebrity-driven go-to-market model, prompting Choo to open his first stores in the United States, in New York City and Los Angeles. Mellon’s Get Good Ink PR agency dyed the Jimmy Choos they loaned to celebrities at the Academy Awards in hues that matched their gowns, bringing the company greater notice in early 1999.</p><p>Businessman Robert Bensoussan founded Equity Luxury Holdings with David Burns of Phoenix Equity Partners in 2001. Following that, Yearnoxe, a new holding company, took over J. Choo Limited’s European and US operations. Choo sold his investment in Yearnoxe for £8.8 million and departed the company, with Equinox owning 51% and Mellon and her father owning the other 49%. J. Choo Limited changed hands several times throughout the years, including acquisitions by Lion Capital, TowerBrook Capital Partners, Gala Capital, and Labelux. The company went public on the London Stock Exchange in late 2014, and it remained there until it was purchased by Michael Kors Holdings in late 2017.</p><p>Choo founded Jimmy Choo Couture Limited in 2006 as a distinct endeavor from the Jimmy Choo ready-to-wear brand to continue his work on his exclusive shoe line. The shoes, which are sold under license by J. Choo Limited, are only available by appointment at Connaught Street in London.</p><p>Choo has received numerous awards for his contributions to fashion. In appreciation of his contributions to the United Kingdom, he was named an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 2002. Choo was awarded an honorary fellowship by the University of the Arts London to round out the decade. He was also named a Commander of the Order of the Meritorious Service in his own country of Malaysia in 2013.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqOgpqWpYrCpu85maWg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kristen-ledlow.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kristen Ledlow Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Family">&larr;
